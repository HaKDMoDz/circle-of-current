These functions are meant for users who would like to stream directly from the MISO line to another device
For example, when streaming mp3 data to a VS1002d decoder, pre_byte can be used to wait until there is room in the decoder's buffer
and pre_block and post_block can be used to select and deselect the decoder's SDI bus

If not needed, these functions can be empty functions, but they must be provided.

This function must be called at least once before calling stream_file

Notes:

FILINFO can be a file, a directory, or nothing
if the file name is empty, it is invalid and indicates that the entire directory has been read and you need to rewind the file index, or that the directory is empty
to check if the file name is empty, check if the first char of the FILINFO's fname is null, for example:

FILINFO fnfo;
int err = PFFS.read_dir(&fnfo);
if (fnfo.fname[0] == 0) print("end of directory");

if the FILINFO is a directory, check if the AM_DIR flag in the FILINFO's fattrib is set, for example:

FILINFO fnfo;
int err = PFFS.read_dir(&fnfo);
if (fnfo.fattrib & AM_DIR) print("is a directory"); else print("is a file");

Notes:

the actual file path opened is the last path used in open_dir joined with the file name provided by fnfo
this means that the FILINFO must be read from the same directory or else this will fail
if fnfo is a directory, that directory will be opened and become the current directory
